# Fantasy Premier League Stats, Visualizations &amp; Analysis

Simple python web app with FPL stats, visualizations and anlysis.
Live at [fantasy.elek.hr](http://fantasy.elek.hr/).

## Running locally
  - Clone this repository
  - Fetch latest data from `scraper` submodule
  ```
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  cd scraper
  git pull origin master
  ```

### With Docker
  - Set the value of `IP` environment variable in `variables.env` to `127.0.0.1`
  - Run `docker-compose build`
  - Run `docker-compose up -d`
  - Application will be available at [localhost](http://localhost/)
  
### Natively
  - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install requirements
  - Set the `IP` environment variable to `127.0.0.1` (eq. in PowerShell run `$env:FPL_IP="127.0.0.1"`, in Bash run `export FPL_IP="127.0.0.1"`)
  - Set the `FPL_SEASON` environment variable to `2018-19` (eq. in PowerShell run `$env:FPL_SEASON="2018-19"`, in Bash run `export FPL_SEASON="2018-19"`)
  - Run `python .\web\app.py`.
  - In another terminal window, run `bokeh serve .\bokeh\vpc.py .\bokeh\aggregate.py --allow-websocket-origin=localhost:5000`
  - Application will be available at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/)

> Note: On subsequent runs, if you want to skip regenerating required static files for application, run it with `skip-init` flag, like: `python .\web\app.py --skip-init`.

## Features
Currently, there are three avaliable features
	- Players Comparison
	- Points Per Cost Analysis
	- 2D Analysis

### Players Comparison
Players Comparison is exactly what it sounds it is. Take two players and compare them on number of factors: price, gained points, performance index, in-game stats, or popularity among FPL managers. There are also some handy line plots visualizing the trends in player's price, points, playing time and ICT index.

### Points PerÂ Cost Analysis
Points Per Cost scatter plot visualizes relationship between each player's price and their average points gain. Blue circles on the plot are goalkeepers, orange ones are defenders, midfielders are in green and forwards are red circles. Larger circle means you get better value for your money. It is also possible to filter plot by a certain position, for better visibility.

### 2D Analysis
2D analysis plot visualizes relationship between any pair of each player's aggregated metrics. For example, the plot given in the screenshot below shows the relationship between average players' ICT index and their average points gain.
